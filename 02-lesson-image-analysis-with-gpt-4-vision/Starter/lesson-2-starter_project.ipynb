    "Welcome to the second lesson on multimodal AI! Today, we're diving into the fascinating world of image analysis using GPT-4 Vision. Imagine an AI system that can look at an image and describe it in detail, and answer questions about its content. In this lesson, you'll explore the fundamentals of how GPT-4 Vision works, its applications, and its current limitations. You'll gain hands-on experience in using this technology, learning how to prepare images for analysis, make API requests, and interpret the API responses.\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement image analysis using GPT-4 with vision capabilities\n",
    "- Process and prepare images for API requests\n",
    "- Interpret and utilize the AI's analysis of image content\n",
    "\n",
    "These skills will not only give you a deeper understanding of multimodal AI but also equip you with practical knowledge that's highly relevant in your industry."

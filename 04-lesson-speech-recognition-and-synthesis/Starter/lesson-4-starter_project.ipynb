    "- Speech Recognition using the Whisper model\n",
    "- Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Implement speech recognition using OpenAI's Whisper model\n",
    "- Utilize OpenAI's text-to-speech capabilities for audio synthesis\n",
    "- Design a basic voice interaction feature in an application\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll start by looking at how to convert spoken language into written text using the Whisper model. Then, you'll flip the process and learn how to generate natural-sounding speech from text. Finally, you'll combine these technologies to create a simple but powerful voice interaction feature.\n",
